# Symmetrical_Encryption-Examples
This repo contains pseudocode and code examples of various symmetrical encryption algorithms. Symmetrical encryption, also known as symmetric-key encryption, uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.

Algorithms Included
1.Feistel Encipherment
2.DES (Data Encryption Standard)
3.AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
